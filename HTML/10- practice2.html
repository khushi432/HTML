    <p>Great Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development <br> of India’s 
        missile and nuclear weapons programs.</p>
    <h1>About the Legend</h1>
    <p>☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
    </p>
    <p>☛ He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
    </p>
    <p>☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
    </p>
    <p>☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
    </p>
    <p>☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.”
    </p>
    <p>☛ Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
    </p>
    <p> He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political
         role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
          original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
    <p>☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific 
        adviser (1999–2001) to the government
         with the rank of cabinet minister.</p>
         <p>☛ His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
             although the tests caused great concern 
             in the international community.</p>
    <p>
        ☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
